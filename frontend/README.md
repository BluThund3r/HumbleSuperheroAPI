# Humble Heroes Frontend

This application is built with `React`, using `Material UI` and other useful packages.

## About

It has a single page, where the heroes fetched from the backend are displayed. There is also a button on the top right to create a new hero on the server. After creating a new one, the list is refreshed.

## How to run the app

### Before you run it

#### Make sure you run the backend first!

The FE application runs on port 3000 by default. If you want to change the port, in the directory `frontend` create a file called `.env` and just paste this `PORT=<desired port>`.

### Run the app

After cloning the repository, open a terminal and change the directory to `frontend`. Run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies and after that just run `npm run start` to start the app.
