# Humble Superheroes

## About

This is a task for the FullStack NodeJS position at **eJam**.

The project has two parts:

- **back end:** a server-side application that implements two endpoints for hero creation and retrieval of all heroes added so far in an in-memory database; it also containes a few tests.
- **front end:** a web application that displays the list of heroes on the server in a nice way and offers possibility to create new hero entries.

**To learn more about each part, explore the `README.md` files in each sub-directory**

## Team collaboration

As long as working in a team is concerned, I tried to write code that can be flexible and reusable and if I were to collaborate with other developers, I would to exactly that. I would try to find each independent element both on the back-end and front-end sides and implement them in a general way, to make them as reusable as possible. I would interact with other teammates' work using Git and GitHub, separate branches for independent features and pull requests in order to merge those features into one big feature or to compose the final product.

## If I had more time

I would have improved this app in some ways, and to name a few:

- store more information about the superheroes in a proper database and have individual pages for each superhero to display all their details;
- have a filtering, sorting and searching option in the front-end application to easily find the superheroes that the user is looking for;
- have a rating/ranking system where logged in users could give each superhero an out of 5 star rating, and based on those ratings there would be a top of favorite superheroes;
- add the possibility to delete entries and update the information about already added superheroes;
- add images, either stored on the server or on an external website (e.g. img.ur) in order to have a better visualisation of the superhero.
